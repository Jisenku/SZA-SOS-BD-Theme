# SOS Theme for BD

Based on DevilBro's Basic Background Theme: https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground

## Theme Preview

*The cat is not part of the theme, it's another plugin lol*

## Installation
Just import the css file by copypasting it, or download the css file from the releases

### Notes
pomf.cat is going down so I'm shifting to just hosting the images on github and pulling from there.
