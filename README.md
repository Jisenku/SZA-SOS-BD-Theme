# SOS Theme for BD

Based on DevilBro's Basic Background Theme: https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/BasicBackground

## Theme Preview

*The cat is not part of the theme, it's another plugin lol*

## Installation
Just import the css file by copypasting it, or download the css file from the releases

### Notes
The background image is a pomf.cat hosted file, if you have any qualms about using a hosted file (or a file from that website) I have uploaded the original image for you to host on a different service, or create a local image or whatever it's called.
